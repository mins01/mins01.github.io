### IP 127.0.0.1

You can't capture on the local loopback address 127.0.0.1 with a Windows packet capture driver likeÂ [WinPcap](https://wiki.wireshark.org/WinPcap). The following page from "Windows network services internals" explains why:Â [The missing network loopback interface](https://web.archive.org/web/20171012161338/http://www.hsc.fr/ressources/articles/win_net_srv/missing_loopback.html).


You can, however, use a raw socket sniffer likeÂ [RawCap](http://www.netresec.com/?page=RawCap)Â to capture localhost network traffic in Windows.
